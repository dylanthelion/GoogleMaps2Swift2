This is a port of the OpenInGoogleMaps project, located here:

https://github.com/googlemaps/OpenInGoogleMaps-iOS

This project uses the Google Maps URL Scheme to integrate Google Maps with your application. Much of the code in it has been recently deprecated, and rather than update the application, I decided to port the code to Swift, v. 2.0. It's a straight port, as close as I've been able to manage (some of the Obj-C classes have more functionality than their Swift counterparts).



The project is functional, but unpolished. Since the URL Scheme won't run in the simulator, I've only been able to test the code and view constraints on my iPad. And, the bits where I diverged from the original code are intentionally simplistic, and need optimization. I suspect that somebody, perhaps Google, will offer a more finished project eventually, but this works for now, and I welcome your input.

Enjoy!
